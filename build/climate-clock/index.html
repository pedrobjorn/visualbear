                            Designed to connect with the visual identity, the core was centered around the circular nature of a clock, earth, and the letter C. Inspired by an existing logo Climate Clock logo concept, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Timer-Optional-Ticking-Management/dp/B06XKV7C2W" alt="TTO Time Amazon link" target="_blank">Sprint MOD Timer</a>, and a logo by <a href="http://www.logobook.com/logo/kino-studio/" alt="Kino Studio link" target="_blank">Stefan Kanchev for Kino Studio</a>, the two circles represent two C’s.

                            Made to work with the two brand colours: Red and Green, the logotype uses the Logomark “C”, while the “O” also based on the C shape.

The inner logomark “circle” can have any angle, while the outer one should always be at 270 degrees.

                                Another key design decision was to implement and address the "Climate Clock App". Turning it into a "Display" section, this works both as an App and a part of the site, both made to be presented, be it on projectors, or on a smart-watch.
                            </p>

                                The Mobile Display / App does have a limited use. Due to this, an Action Fab should be added to the core view in the app. It can still serve as an interesting data display view, perhaps connectable to a projector.

                                Working with a project that included the word "clock", it was inevitable that there would be a smart watch app concept. Naturally this is a very limited app, due to it's very long-term time scale, it's still a good way to spread the word.

                    <p>
                        My goal with the project was to provide a redesign proposal for an existing property within 6 weeks, focusing on the visual design. These are the key lessons we learnt while doing so:
                    </p>

                    <div class="paragraph-container--unpadded">
                        <h4>Talk to the stakeholders</h4>
                        <p>
                            Even though this was a small scoped visual design project, I still got in touch with the team, who graciously provided me with design assets I used for reference. This was invaluable and helped a long way to legitimise the work.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Always do an Audit</h4>          
                        <p>
                            The focus may have been the visual design, however I still created a full UX, UI and Content Audit. The main purpose for this was to ensure I was fully understanding what I was redesigning, and not just focusing on the surface.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h4>Do visual research &amp; keep ideating</h4>
                        <p>
                            I struggled early on to find a good art direction and visual language. Ultimately it was about just keeping on coming up with new ideas, and not to give up. Visual research helped a lot as well in providing me with inspiration and confidence in which direction to take.
                        </p>
                    </div>
               
                    <h2 class="center-justified">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I wanted to emphasize on the visual design and art direction of a redesign. Less emphasis was given to the UX or Product perspective, since the focus of Climate Clock is to grab attnention and inform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was super gratifying and fun, and I learned a lot about prototyping, animation and visual design. I also shared everything with the Climate Clock team, and will be available to assist them if they with to use any of the work.
                    </p>
