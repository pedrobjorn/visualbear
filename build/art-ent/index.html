							<p><i>art ent</i> is an app that artists can use to find people to give lessons to, and to manage those lessons. Students can find lessons, created by artists; view lessons and artist profiles, and contact them to book a lesson.</p>
						
							<p>It was a side-projct between two friends, where I worked on the Design and Front-end, while <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-rappoldi-a3548057?challengeId=AQFcMZHMAFt9BwAAAXTA2a2kMt4Nll0Jmmp7jjSYMJMzQdQ3uB9kwS_E-OXYvVNoSpwJrjLtGQA49o7CB5E_oh9scBF0P8kduA&submissionId=7b11a422-a7c3-3716-4f97-7f0b0cd9f855" alt="Riccardos Linkedin profile" target="_blank">Riccardo</a> worked on the back-end.</p>

					<h3>Challenge</h3>
					<p>Artists have no tool to connect with people who want to learn their skills, and have to resort to local announcement boards, public announcement boards, and word of mouth. People wanting to learn rely on word of mouth and social media, with no consolidated go to source for artistic lessons.</p>

					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ul>
						
							<li>
								<p>- Create a tool for artists to find students.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p>- Allow for artists to create a basic profile.</p>
							</li>

                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>We originally heard from circus students that they struggled a lot with booking and managing private lessons they gave on the side to make money.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Talking to people</h3>
                        <p>The approach to research for this project was relaxed and kept quite centered around the circus performers we knew, as well as immediate acquaintances.</p>

                        <p>When talking to the performers we learned:
                            </p><ul>
                                <li>- Heavily reliant on word of mouth, social media.</li>
                                <li>- Very unreliable work due to lack of control over spread of information.</li>
                                <li>- Difficult to keep track of lessons and times.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>Talking to students (i.e anybody that's not an artist), and we learnt that:
                            </p><ul>
                                <li>- Most don't know where to look, resort to word of mouth of social media.</li>
                                <li>- Very trust based, rely on word of mouth for trust.</li>
                                <li>- Little follow up, motivation due to lack of awareness where to find lessons.</li>

                            </p><ul>
                                <li>- People don't have a go-to tool for finding, and providing, artistic lessons.</li>
                                <li>- Artists specifically lack a tool to help them share their skill with others, loss of potential work.</li>
                                <li>- All existing tools are spread out and not made for these particular needs, makes this process stressful and chaotic.</li>

                        <p>The ideation process took place over a few sessions of getting together and brainstorming basically anything we felt an app for artists would have to cover and feel like.</p>
                        
                        <p>Looking back, I should have taken the brainstorm sessions further with sketches and exercises. But this was enough to set us on a unified direction at least.</p>

                        <p>As previously defined, we ensured the brand was bold yet simple, with no frills. Despite expectations, the artists we spoke to were not very tech focused, and were interested in getting lessons booked and tracked more easily.</p>
                        <p>We decided to focus on the following:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>- Lo-fi</li>
                            <li>- Bold</li>

                            We decided to go with pastel purples and pastel blues to its association with creativity and calm. It also would differentiate us since purple isn't a very common app colour.

                            The logo design was quite informal and very free form in experimentation. We mostly decided to go with a play on the letters "a" and "e".

                        <p>We quickly pivoted to simplify the app, removing any payment system, and focusing on connecting students and artists. We also removed on-boarding at the start of the app, and only required an account creation for users that wanted to give lessons.</p>

                        <h3>Development</h3>
                        <p>One of the main goals of this project was to learn how to build a hybrid mobile app, so we kicked off with <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" alt="Ionic Framework link"> Ionic 2.0</a>, which at the time was one of the two big Hybrid app frameworks, the other being React Native.</p>
                        
                        <div class="gallery-image--small">
                            <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" alt="Ionic Framework link">

                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Having worked with Angular and Cordova before, Ionic was the natural choice for me. I didn't want to learn a brand-new framework on top of learning hybrid app development.
                        &nbsp;
                        However, looking back, perhaps React Native would have been the better choice.</p>

                        <p>Another important requirement was to follow the Vendor Design Principles as closely as possible. This meant using the ios- (Apple's iOS UIKit) and mb- (Androids Material Design UI Kit) rules of the frame work as much as possible.</p>
                    </div>


                    <h3>The app</h3>
                    <p>We settled on what we felt was an adequate prototype releasable as a Alpha on the Play Store (pending). </p>


                    <p>Although I wish it were more refined and has better visual presentation, we felt this was a good first version of the app to get it to be useful and to be testable. </p>

                            For the Registration we tried to focus on what we needed, like general location, phone number and Category of focus. In retrospect, we should have made details like Phone Number optional.

                    <h3 class="center-justified">Lessons Learnt</h3>
                    <p>When we set off on this project, we did so in order to learn more about mobile app development. These are the key lessons we learnt while doing so:
                    </p>
                    <div class="paragraph-container--unpadded">
                        <h4>Prototype early</h4>
                        <p>We were too excited to learn how to build the app to give prototyping and testing the adequate amount of time. This might have more to do with the nature of the project, but it would have helped us to find issues earlier on. </p>
                        
                        <h4>Keep it simple</h4>          
                        <p>Starting off trying to implement a Payment system was a big mistake. The best design is when nothing else can be removed, and we definitely benefited from editing here.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Don't try to do everything</h4>
                        <p>We were doing this to learn new things, so that's fine, but if we would ever try to do this more seriously, we'd definitely have to bring on developers, researchers and marketers to ensure the app could be as good as possible.</p>

                        <h4>Other Design considerations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>- Hiding / showing different Nav Bar options depending on student or artists wasn't optimal, goes against Apple UI Guidelines.</li>
                            <li>- We should have added steps to the Registration and Lesson Creation wizards.</li>
                            <li>- We should have allowed for registering with Social Media accounts.</li>
                            <li>- We should have allowed for connecting with Instagram for the image gallery.</li>
                            <li>- We should have made adding the phone number optional, allowed options for which way Artists could be contacted.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2 class="center-justified">Conclusion</h2>
                    <div class="paragraph-container--unpadded">
                        <p> <b>art ent</b> was an endeavor that took more time and effort than we could have ever imagined, however, it was a rewarding experience and we learned a lot about mobile app development, and general product development. </p>
                        <p>We feel that for two people, starting with little to no Mobile App design and development experience, we came a long way, and if we were to start the app anew, we'd do a lot different.</p>
